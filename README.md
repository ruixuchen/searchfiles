# searchfiles
In Mac system, there is an efficient way to searching files which contains specified string. But Windows does not have a similar one.
The most frequently used software called Everything in Windows can only search with file names instead of the content. So this searchfiles tool is for this purpose.
In order to improve performance, this small tool is based on Fork/Join framework, which is a derivative of Executors.
